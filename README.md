# Horiseon

Purpose of project was to debug and improve accesibilty of the Horiseon website. Bugs solves were a missing ID causing one of the navigation links not to function. For accessibility, all elements were changed to semantic HTML elements. Switching to semantic elements also allowed clean up of the CSS style sheet.
